This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue: conflicts due to specificity. The `bug.css` file showcases a scenario where inline styles, class selectors, and ID selectors conflict, resulting in unexpected styling. The `bugSolution.css` file offers a solution by reorganizing selectors and using the `!important` flag (sparingly) to resolve the conflicts while maintaining clean and maintainable code.
